## TESTING AND VALIDATION

When I tested the website I used a mix of different devices such as phones, tablets, and computers, as well as the virtual devices that come with developer tools. 

I also set a link to many friends and asked them to open and have a look and let me know if they could find any errors, they may be biased, but they all thought it looked OK and could see nothing wrong with it.

I also validated my HTML & CSS code on the W3C Site, and Lighhouse
